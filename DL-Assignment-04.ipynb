A new Functional API model can also be created by using the intermediate tensors. This enables you to quickly extract sub-components of the model. Note that the backbone and activations models are not created with keras.Input objects, but with the tensors that are originated from keras.Inputs objects. Under the hood, the layers and weights will be shared across these models, so that user can train the full_model, and use backbone or activations to do feature extraction. The inputs and outputs of the model can be nested structures of tensors as well, and the created models are standard Functional API models that support all the existing APIs.\n",
